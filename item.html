                <h3>General Features of the <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b></h3>
                <p class="fst-italic"> These are some of the characteristics that makes our machine outstanding and
                    unique.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> Usually, spinning machines need at least 7-13 meters high
                        sheds. However, since this machine has a small size, it can be placed in any place without
                        having to invest large capitals in special sheds.</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> Two <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> could produce the same
                        quantity produced by a conventional spinning machine.</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> Two <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> have same price of a single
                        conventional spinning machine.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nevertheless, it benefits because it gives:<ul>
                            <li> - Possibility of producing of two types of yarn simultaneously, colour and/or count.
                            </li>
                            <li> - Possibility of serving two customers simultaneously.</li>
                            <li> - Possibility of continuing production with one machine while the other under
                                maintenance.</li>
                            <li> - Possibility of fulfilling small orders.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> The <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> has 5 Godets which means 5
                        drawing steps and a better yarn quality.</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> The power consumption in small machines is much lower than in
                        conventional machines. This means savings in production costs. (<b>Mini Spinning Machine</b>
                        takes 20 kW installed and consumes only 13 kW during operation).</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> is easy to handle, this means
                        greater ease of learning for workers.</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> On the other hand, customers no longer place orders for 1000
                        kg per colour; but they ask for 150-200 kg. Therefore, the <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> is ideal
                        for small orders.</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> The waste percentage produced from colour change by the
                        <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> is smaller in comparison to the conventional machines;</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> Expanding the yarn industry with our <b>Mini Spinning
                            Machine</b> means varying production and more flexibility in serving customers. The
                        traditional machine largely produces for a single specific item. Splitting the production with
                        more <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> means diversifying production.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <b>Mini Spinning Machine</b> brings countless benefits, but for sure, it significantly cuts down
                    costs when it comes to production.</p>
